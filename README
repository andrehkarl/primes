SpringBoot microservice calculating prime numbers

Build with
$ mvn clean package

Run unit and integration test with
$ mvn test

Run application with (after building it) 
$ java -jar target/primes-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

Interactive tests with curl
-------------------------------
$ curl localhost:8080/primes/10
{"initial":10,"primes":[2,3,5,7]}

Test content type XML
$ curl --header "Accept:application/xml" localhost:8080/primes/10
<Primes><initial>10</initial><primes><primes>2</primes><primes>3</primes><primes>5</primes><primes>7</primes></primes></Primes>

Use parallel algorithm to do calculation.
$ curl localhost:8080/primes/100000?parallelalgo=true
{"initial":100001,"primes":[2,3,5,7,11,13, ... prime numbers up to 100000 ... ]}

Note:
The time taken for the prime number calculation of each request can be seen on
stdout of the terminal primes-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar is running from.

The application is caching all calculated results against the 'initial' parameter as key.
So subsequent request with the same value for parameter 'initial' will be served from cache 
and no calculation time will be shown on stdout.

Tested in the following environment:

$ mvn --version
